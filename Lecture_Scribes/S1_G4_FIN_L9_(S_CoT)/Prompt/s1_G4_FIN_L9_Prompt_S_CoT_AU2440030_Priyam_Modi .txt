PROMPT 1 FOR THE SCRIBE

Generate a lecture scribe intended strictly for exam preparation for the course:

CSE 400: Fundamentals of Probability and Random Variables
(SEAS, Ahmedabad University)

The scribe must faithfully reproduce the lecture “Types of Continuous Random Variables”, including:

Formal definitions

Worked examples

Problem-solving portions

In-class activity on Gaussian Simulation and Gaussian Density Estimation

All numerical examples and probability questions must be taken strictly from the question images provided by the user for each random variable.
Do not create, modify, or add any questions of your own.

General Writing Rules

For each random variable, begin with brief formal content only:

Definition

Support

Probability Density Function (PDF)

Immediately after the formal content, solve the question exactly as shown in the uploaded image corresponding to that random variable.

Use only the formulas, probability expressions, integrals, transformations, identities, figures, and code constructs required to solve the provided question.

Write all derivations, computations, and steps explicitly and sequentially, exactly as done in lecture.

Do not add intuition, motivation, commentary, interpretations, shortcuts, or alternative methods.

Do not introduce new examples, exercises, assumptions, or conclusions.

Maintain exam-oriented formatting and notation consistency with classroom lectures.

Required Lecture Structure

(Follow This Order Exactly)

1. Uniform Random Variable

Include:

Definition of a continuous uniform random variable

Support

Probability Density Function (PDF)

Then:

2. Exponential Random Variable

Include:

Definition of an exponential random variable

Support

Probability Density Function (PDF)

Then:

Solve only the question shown in the uploaded image for the Exponential Random Variable.

Perform all probability calculations and transformations step by step.

If a random variable transformation is required, derive the CDF and PDF exactly as demonstrated in class.

3. Laplace Random Variable

Include:

Definition of a Laplace random variable

Support

Probability Density Function (PDF)

Then:

Solve only the question shown in the uploaded image for the Laplace Random Variable.

Write all integrals with limits and evaluate them explicitly.

4. Gamma Random Variable

Include:

Definition of the Gamma function as used in class

Then:

Reproduce the proofs or derivations exactly as shown in the lecture and corresponding question image.

Include only identities, steps, and results that appear in the lecture.

Include any homework problem statement only if shown in the image, without adding a solution unless explicitly demonstrated in class.

5. In-Class Activity: Gaussian Simulation and Gaussian Density Estimation

(Google Colab)

Present this section at the end of the scribe, structured exactly as a classroom coding demonstration.

Activity Overview

Simulate Gaussian random variables

Visualize probability distributions

Learn Gaussian density estimation from data

Apply the method to real-world problems

Step-by-Step Activity Structure

1. Motivation

Real-world measurements are uncertain due to noise and randomness

Examples:

Sensor measurements

Network packet delays

Image sensor noise

2. Gaussian Simulation with Known Parameters

Import required libraries (numpy, matplotlib)

Define:

Number of samples

True mean

True standard deviation

Generate Gaussian samples using randomized simulation

3. Visualizing the Distribution

Construct a histogram with fixed bin widths

Compute histogram centers

Define the true Gaussian PDF using known parameters

Plot histogram and true PDF together

4. Reality Check: Unknown Parameters

Real-world data provides only samples

Parameters are unknown a priori

5. Gaussian Density Estimation from Data

Generate Gaussian samples

Add measurement noise

Construct histogram of observed data

Estimate parameters:

Sample mean

Sample standard deviation

Construct estimated Gaussian PDF

Plot histogram and estimated PDF together

6. Application: Packet Delay in Networks

Simulate packet delay using a Gaussian model

Apply non-negative delay constraint

Construct histogram

Estimate Gaussian parameters

Plot observed delays and estimated density

7. Key Takeaways

Gaussian simulation uses randomized algorithms

Density estimation learns distributions from data

The same methodology applies across applications

Important Instruction

All mathematical problems, numerical values, and probability questions must be extracted directly from the uploaded question images.
Do not restate the question unless necessary; proceed directly to the solution in lecture style.


PROMPT 2 FOR THE SCRIBE TO LATEX TRANSITION

Generate a LaTeX code based on the given Lecture Scribe. Do not change any equation or word formation initially in the Scribe and also do not include any other external information or concepts which are not already in the Scribe. do not include This scribe **faithfully reproduces the lecture** using **only** the material, numerical values, and questions visible in the uploaded images. No additional examples, interpretations, shortcuts, or assumptions are introduced. All steps are written **explicitly and sequentially**, following classroom notation and structure.
