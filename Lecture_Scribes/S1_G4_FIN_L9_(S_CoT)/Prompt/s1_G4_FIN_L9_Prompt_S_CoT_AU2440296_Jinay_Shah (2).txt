Generate a lecture scribe intended strictly as exam-oriented reference material for
CSE 400: Fundamentals of Probability in Computing – Lecture 9, covering continuous random variables, as taught in the lecture.

Use only the provided context:

Lecture 9 slides / lecture PDF

Any explicitly relevant textbook content directly associated with Lecture 9

Do not introduce any material, definitions, notation, explanations, intuition, assumptions, examples, proofs, applications, or results that are not explicitly present in the provided context.

While writing the scribe, reason step by step exactly as done in the lecture, and include all reasoning in the final scribe, covering:

Definition of continuous random variables

Probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) as presented

Uniform random variable

PDF and CDF definitions

Graphical interpretation exactly as shown

Worked example(s) with all intermediate probability calculations

Exponential random variable

PDF and CDF definitions

Graphical interpretation as shown

Worked example(s), including generalization steps exactly as derived in the lecture

Any applications, interpretations, or problem-solving steps explicitly discussed in class

Ensure that:

All derivations, probability computations, inequalities, and transformations are shown step by step

The order, structure, notation, and logical flow strictly follow the lecture

Every example is reconstructed exactly as solved in the lecture, with no compression or omission

Maintain a formal academic tone suitable for a reading-based / closed-notes examination.

Do not:

Add summaries, commentary, or intuition

Simplify explanations

Introduce alternative solution methods

Reorder topics

Add material not traceable to the lecture or textbook context

The final output must be a faithful, complete reconstruction of Lecture 9, such that a student studying only this scribe can reliably reproduce all definitions, derivations, and example solutions from the lecture.
