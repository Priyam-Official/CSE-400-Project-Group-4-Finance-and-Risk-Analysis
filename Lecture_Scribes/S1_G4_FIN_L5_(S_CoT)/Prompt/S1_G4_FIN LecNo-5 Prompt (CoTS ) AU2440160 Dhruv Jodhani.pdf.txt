You are generating a lecture scribe intended to serve as formal reference material for closed-notes exam preparation.

Use ONLY the attached lecture slides / lecture PDF as context. Do NOT use any textbook or external knowledge.

The scribe must be a faithful reconstruction of what was taught in class. Every definition, notation, assumption, result, proof step, derivation step, and example step must be directly traceable to the provided slides.

While writing the scribe, explicitly reason step by step through:

- Definitions and notation
- Assumptions and conditions
- Statements of results or theorems
- Proofs or derivations (only where they appear in the slides)
- Worked examples (only where they appear in the slides), including all intermediate steps

Make all logical dependencies between concepts explicit so that a student can reliably revise using only this document.

Follow the lecture’s original structure and scope. Preserve ordering of topics as presented.

Maintain a formal academic tone suitable for exam revision.

STRICT CONSTRAINTS:

- Do NOT introduce intuition, interpretations, simplifications, or additional explanations.
- Do NOT add new examples, proofs, or derivations.
- Do NOT infer missing steps unless they are explicitly shown in the slides.
- Do NOT use background knowledge.
- Do NOT invent content.

This output is a lecture scribe for exam preparation, not a tutorial, summary, or creative explanation.
