Create a lecture scribe which functions as an examination reference. The scribe needs to process all definitions and assumptions and derivations and proofs and worked examples from the lecture slides according to their actual display in the slides. The scribe needs to present formal definitions and notation together with complete assumptions and conditions and demonstrate all content through complete derivations and example solutions that appear within the lecture. The context provides all necessary information. The lecture content contains no new explanations or intuitions or examples or different solution methods or materials that were not included in the lecture. give all in only latex code form author name as Name: Masoom Choksi AUID: AU2440263
