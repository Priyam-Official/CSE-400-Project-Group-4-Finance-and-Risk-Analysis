PROMPT 1 FOR THE SCRIBE

Generate a lecture scribe intended strictly as exam-oriented reference material for the course CSE 400: Fundamentals of Probability in Computing. The scribe must be a faithful and exam-ready reconstruction of the lecture and must be written so that a student can rely on it as the sole reference while preparing for a closed-notes or reading-based examination.
The content provided below is the complete and only authoritative context for this task. You must use only this context and nothing else. You must not infer missing steps, assume unstated results, introduce external knowledge, or add any intuition, summaries, or explanations that are not explicitly present in the lecture. Every statement included in the scribe must be directly traceable to the lecture material.
While writing the scribe, go through the lecture step by step, exactly as it appears. All definitions and notation must be included. All assumptions and conditions must be clearly stated. All propositions, formulas, and theorems must be written exactly as presented. If the lecture contains any proofs or derivations, they must be written in full. Every question, problem, and example appearing in the lecture must be completely solved. No example, question, or computation may be left unanswered or partially worked. All intermediate steps must be written explicitly whenever they appear in the lecture. All reasoning must come only from the provided lecture context.
The scribe must explicitly include and fully solve, exactly as presented in the lecture:
•	Bayes’ Theorem expressed as a weighted average of conditional probabilities
•	The Law of Total Probability
•	Bayes Formula (Proposition 3.1)
•	Example 3.1, including both Part 1 and Part 2 with complete solutions
•	Example 3.2, including the card problem, the discussion of incorrect reasoning, and the final probability calculation
•	Random Variables, including their motivation, definition, and examples
•	The coin toss example with complete probability assignments
•	The Probability Mass Function (PMF), including its definition, properties, and all PMF examples solved exactly as shown in the lecture
The scribe must not include any new or additional examples, alternative solution methods, intuition, interpretation beyond the lecture content, or any form of simplification or summarization.
The writing must maintain a formal academic tone suitable for exam revision and must follow the same order and logical flow as the lecture slides. Correctness, completeness, and faithfulness to the lecture are more important than stylistic elegance.
The final output must be a single, continuous lecture scribe document in which every question and example from the lecture is explicitly and completely solved, allowing a student to revise the entire lecture without any missing steps.





PROMPT 2 FOR THE SCRIBE TO LATEX TRANSITION

Generate a LaTeX code based on the given Lecture Scribe. Do not change any equation or word formation initially in the Scribe and also do not include any other external information or concepts which are not already in the Scribe.
